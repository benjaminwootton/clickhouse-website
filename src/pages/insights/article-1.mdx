    When it comes to adopting AI in business, we believe there is a useful distinction to be made between how AI can help individual employees and how it can be used in the back office to intelligently automate business processes. There are different methods, tools and considerations for these two types of AI deployment, and thinking about your business's AI strategy through these two distinct lenses can make the opportunities for AI adoption much clearer.

    ## Individual Automation

    When most people think of AI, they imagine a ChatGPT style experience. This usually involves a conversational UI used by a single employee to ask questions, generate content, or automate a piece of work.

    In this mode, AI serves as a productivity tool that can make individual employees and knowledge workers more efficient and effective in their work.

    ```js
    if (employee.department().equals("sales") {
        create_salesforce_account();
    }
    ```

    The task for business leaders is to think about how they can help their employees take this further. Which tasks can AI best assist with? Which specialised UIs do we need to build for them? Which data sources do we need to connect to? How do we help our employees make use of AI without exposing us to risk? To be clear, we don't think that individual automation is as simple as just giving your employees access to ChatGPT or Claude in an unconstrained way. A much more measured, thoughtful and integrated approach is required in order to harness the full value of AI at an individual level, and most businesses are still at the first level of maturity on this journey.

    Consider an end to end business process associated with onboarding a new employee:

    - Individual automation - An HR team member talks to the new hire over the phone to capture demographic details, work history, and a skills profile. The voice call is transcribed by an AI model and converted into structured data. The HR member can then review the transcription and submit the record into the HR system through their copilot.
    - Business automation - An AI agent identifies the new employee record and automatically sends reference requests to previous employers by email.
    - Business automation - A seperate agent looks at the person’s job role and skills profile and automatically enrolls them in relevant training courses.
    - Team automation - The training team could use a collaborative AI powered interface to personalize the training schedule for the employee. They make use of their prompt library to ensure a consistent approach to upskilling across the global business.
    - Individual automation - The employee could finally use some individual automation to complete their personalised training, asking the AI to prompt them with quizzes and generate example sceanarios to help them pass their upcoming exams.
